# computer-security
An intuitive and powerful cryptography project designed to simplify the encryption and decryption process for users with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). 

 ## How to run
- Open the main.py file on a Python editor Pycharm is preferred
- Type this command on the editor's local terminal: streamlit run main.py
- The app screens would be displayed 

### The project employs six cryptography algorithms:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Playfair Cipher
3. One-time pad Cipher
4. Rail fence Cipher
5. Row Column transposition Cipher
6. Hill Cipher

#### Each algorithm allows you to either encrypt or decrypt text.
